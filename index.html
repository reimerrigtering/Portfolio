            Creation is the most fun of all things. Creating an idea and shaping it into something that works is what
            I love to do. Starting out with bricks when I was young, I started building my ideas and putting them into
            the world. Later on, I discovered coding. Building things with an unlimited number of bricks and tools to
            work with to show my ideas to others.
            <br><br>
            Designing is the process of creating, building something together. It is this process, this challenge,
            which I think is the most interesting part. Finding the best way to combine strengths, cover each other's
            weaknesses to create the absolute best things possible. This is why I will always be excited to design
            and develop with others.

                        Designing is easy, everyone can do it. But designing something well is hard, really hard,
                        actually. This is for me the most important lesson I learned as a designer.
                        It describes the beauty of design for me. Everyone can design. It is something that binds
                        us as people, no matter where youâ€™re from, no matter which language you speak, we all design.
                        It is a connection between all of us.
                        <br><br>
                        But designing well is challenging. It requires creativity,
                        the ability to look at things from a point of view you have never considered yourself and
                        maybe the hardest of all, it requires you to fail, a lot. This is why I think design is best
                        done together. Designing together already helps against pitfalls like being stuck in one
                        perspective or not realizing an idea could be better if you would change it somehow.
                        Generating ideas together will always, always result in a better end product. And this is
                        also what makes design so enjoyable, talking to each other, figuring out what someone means,
                        drawing some quick sketches on a bit of paper lying around. And then, finally, creating
                        something together.

                    <p class="project-text">
                        To create opportunities to connect and stay connected, I wanted to create a new social
                        gathering space by transforming a room in a church located in the Heemskerk city center.
                        <br><br>
                        I designed a social gathering space for teenagers to meet on Sunday evenings so they can meet
                        up and play games. This is a space created to give teenagers a meeting place and is open to
                        everybody. The idea is to stimulate contact between these teenagers and take them outside
                        their own daily bubble. This is all to combat loneliness, provide new perspectives, and offer
                        teenagers a sense of community with people around their own age. This way, they have
                        opportunities to help and support each other.
                        <br><br>
                        This space started as a messy upstairs area of a church in the city center of Heemskerk.
                        Over a period of about 3 months, I designed and built, with the help of some friends, the
                        entire space. First sketching, then over to 3D-moddeling for the bar itself. Creating plans
                        for different possible layouts and talking with many different people about budget,
                        possibilities and how the space could be used outside the youth group as well. And ultimately
                        building everything to realize all the plans.

                    <p class="project-text">
                        To stimulate different senses in new ways, my team and I wanted to approach the senses in new
                        and creative ways. We wanted to do this by creating an artwork which targeted the senses
                        in interesting ways.
                        <br><br>
                        We created this artwork for an exibition within the TU Delft library where it was displayed.
                        The artwork was created focusing on touch, sight, and hearing. Starting by making it possible
                        to touch the artwork everywhere. Feel the interesting shapes and textures throughout the
                        artwork. Then the main part of the artwork consisted of "invisible strings." Using sensors to
                        detect hand movement within the artwork, you could play these strings and different hand
                        positions would correspond to different sounds and lights.
                        <br><br>
                        The lights created new perspectives and lit up different parts of the brightly colored artwork.
                        Next to that, you could even combine sounds and lights by playing multiple strings
                        simultaneously.

                    <p class="project-text">
                        To learn VR-sketching, my team wanted to make a finalized project by creating a
                        hypothetical Mars rover and render our model using Blender.
                        <br><br>
                        We began by creating a full-scale frame to establish the basic shape. Then, through an
                        extensive process, the frame was enclosed using sheets that connected all the ribs. We
                        ensured that every component had double walls to avoid paper-thin surfaces and to provide
                        an interior living space. We added all the necessary elements to make the rover suitable
                        for multi-day missions in the future. Finally, the rover was rendered in Blender to produce
                        high-quality visuals and present the concept in its final form.

                    <p class="project-text">
                        Sketching, drawing, and editing are all import skills while designing. They are essential
                        to create a good design and to communicate with others.
                        <br><br>
                        Sketching lays out a plan, using quick and easy visuals. It is the best way to communicate
                        quickly and is absolutely crucial while brainstorming with a team of people to get your ideas
                        across in the best possible way.
                        <br><br>
                        Drawing and Editing are the next steps. Sketches are nice, but they only take you so far. By
                        drawing your ideas, they are presentable to clients. Being able to edit photos is an important
                        step in finalizing your drawings. Often being needed to best transition your design into digital
                        images for production posters and websites.

                    <p class="project-text">
                        Making things is amazing. Well, coding is like building something, but with an infinite number
                        of building blocks and opportunities right at your fingertips. So many people who
                        have never met, but are collaborating over the internet and helping each other because of their
                        passion for making something great.
                        <br><br>
                        The only real limit in coding is your imagination. Use every building block available and if you
                        can't find the correct blocks? Create them yourself! Explore different languages with their own
                        pros and cons and use your knowledge from one to improve the other and be even
                        better for it.

                        The Quantum Poiesis project is a piece where I did the coding for
                        an artist. It is the first step towards a quantum computer speaking Old English.
                        It was displayed on an art exibition within the TU Delft library.
                        <br><br>
                        This piece runs a quantum computer simulation based on a quantum computer
                        from QuTech. The data from these quantum bits are plotted on a sphere, which are then
                        translated into letters. After linking the letters together into words, phonemes of
                        these words are generated. These are then spoken aloud by the computer using
                        a Text-to-Speech engine. To ensure this system runs continuously in an exhibition,
                        it needed to be robust and capable of running indefinitely without human intervention.
                        <br><br>
                        This piece required a combination of different coding languages, I coded the backend in Python
                        and was asked to do the frontend in Kotlin and
                        <a href="https://openrndr.org/" target="_blank">OPENRNDR</a>. So I learned Kotlin to make it
                        possible, and although the communication between languages created its own challenges,
                        it all worked out amazingly.

                    <p class="project-text">
                        I do a lot of coding just for fun for years now. And my go-to small project has always been
                        small games. I used <a href="https://www.pygame.org/news" target="_blank">pygame</a> for most
                        of these games, but quickly ran into problems with UI elements being too complicated to quickly
                        implement.
                        <br><br>
                        So I decided to create a library on top of pygame that would make it possible to create
                        simple and easy-to-use UI elements. I created a library that would allow you to create
                        buttons, sliders, text boxes, and more. I put a lot of effort into it to make it incredibly
                        flexible and usable in many different contexts and usecases. And I still develop it to
                        this day. And creating games using the library has made my coding experience for these small
                        games infinitely more enjoyable.

                        Designing games is fun, I have made countless quick playable games or translated existing
                        games to the computer screen. I've also built larger games twice, using
                        <a href="https://unity.com/" target="_blank">Unity</a> as the game engine to build the game
                        within.
                        <br><br>
                        The two larger games I have made were both with other people, working in a team to create the
                        best game we could in a tiny bit of time. Using C# for these games to build the scripts which
                        run the game itself. I coded multiple things, but the largest thing I implemented into these
                        group projects was a fully implemented inventory system. Including power-ups and tools for
                        the player to use, yielding different effects and uses.

                        This project was aimed at infinite generatable poem generation within its simpelest form. Using
                        related words to create an infinitly varying chain of related words.
                        <br><br>
                        This was done with two main tools: A LLM API and a Vector database. It implemented a large
                        vector database of words and used it together with the LLM alternating to create a varying
                        chain. First, the LLM would yield a word followed by a related word set to a certain "distance"
                        within the vector database. After that the LLM would yield a new word relating to the previous
                        word. By alternating between these steps, the chain of words could be infinitely long.
