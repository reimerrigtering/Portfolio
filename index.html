            Creation is the most fun of all things. Creating an idea and shaping it into something
            that works is what I love to do. Starting out with bricks when I was young, I started
            building my ideas and putting them into the world. Later on I discovered coding. Building
            things with an unlimited number of bricks and tools to work with to show my ideas to others.

                        I designed a social gathering space for teenagers to meet on Sunday evenings so they can meet
                        up and play games. This is a space created to give teenagers a meeting place and is open to
                        everybody. The idea is to stimulate contact between these teenagers and take them outside
                        their own daily bubble. This is all to combat loneliness, provide new perspectives, and offer
                        teenagers a sense of community with people their own age. This way, they have opportunities to
                        help and support each other.

                        This space started as a messy upstairs area of a church in the city center of Heemskerk.
                        Over a period of about 3 months, I designed and built, with the help of some friends, the
                        entire space. Taking into account budget constraints, flexibility in the purpose of the space,
                        and the fact that the church is a monument, which brings its own restrictions. This project
                        involved sketching, pitching to the church board for a budget, 3D modeling, and ultimately
                        building everything, among many other tasks.

                    <p class="project-text">
                        This artwork was created by a team with the goal of stimulating the senses by using sound,
                        lights, and haptics to draw the user in and make the surroundings fade away. Felt was used
                        to stimulate touch within the artwork, while lights and connected headphones created light
                        and sounds based on the position of your hands within the piece.

                        The artwork has "invisible strings" you can play. Three vertical lines where your hands
                        generate and mix sounds and lights. Different heights produced vibrant tones within octaves,
                        and the various strings corresponded to different colors. When playing multiple strings
                        simultaneously, the sound and light would combine into completely new patterns and effects.

                    <p class="project-text">
                        With a team of three people, I designed a Mars rover using VR sketching. The rover was created
                        by moving in VR and sketching directly into the virtual environment. After many iterations
                        and changes, this was the final result.

                        We began by creating a full-scale frame to establish the basic shape. Then, through an
                        extensive process, the frame was enclosed using sheets that connected all the ribs. We
                        ensured that every component had double walls to avoid paper-thin surfaces and to provide
                        an interior living space. We added all the necessary elements to make the rover suitable
                        for multi-day missions in the future.

                        Finally, the rover was rendered in Blender to produce high-quality visuals and present
                        the concept.
